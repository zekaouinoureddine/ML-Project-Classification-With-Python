## Overview
In this Mini Project, we'll try to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in the [Machine Learning With Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) course. So, we'll load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

## About Dataset
This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th> Field </th><th> Description </th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Loan_status</td>
    <td>Whether a loan is paid off on in collection</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Principal</td>
    <td>Basic principal loan amount at the</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terms</td>
    <td>Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Effective_date</td>
    <td>When the loan got originated and took effects</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Due_date</td>
    <td>Since itâ€™s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>Age of applicant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Education</td>
    <td>Education of applicant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gender</td>
    <td>The gender of applicant</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Algorithms and Technologies
**We used:**
- Python (Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib,numpy) and the amazing ML library **Scikit-learn**  
- IBM Cloud (Waston Studio, Jupyter Notebook)

**For building our models we will be using the folowing algorithms:**
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation
The report below shows the accuracies of all built models using different evaluation metrics:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th> Algorithm </th><th> Jaccard </th> <th> F1-score </th><th> LogLoss </th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>KNN</td>
    <td>0.67</td>
    <td>0.63</td>
    <td>NA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Decision Tree</td>
    <td>0.76</td>
    <td>0.77</td>
    <td>NA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SVM</td>
    <td>0.80</td>
    <td>0.76</td>
    <td>NA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Logistic Regression</td>
    <td>0.74</td>
    <td>0.70</td>
    <td>0.67</td>
  </tr>
</table>
